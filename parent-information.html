          <h2>What should I expect?</h2>
          <p>You will be invited to come for a brief one-time visit to the Infant and Child Language Centre at NUS with your baby, which will last for about half an hour.<br>
          Your baby will sit on your lap and listen to a set of words accompanied by pictures. We will be interested in the pictures that your child looks at in response to the words.<br>
          Your child will be videotaped during the session, but all videotapes will be coded anonymously and discarded once coded. You may request a copy of your child's video record prior to coming for your appointment.<br>
          You will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire on your child's language history.</p>
          <h2>What are the risks?</h2>
          <p>The procedure adopted in our studies do not pose any known risks to you or your baby. Our studies are non-invasive and we simply track children's eye movements as they look at objects on a screen. However, if at any point, you feel uncomfortable in participating in our study at any point, you may choose to withdraw immediately.</p>
          <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
          <p>You will receive a small gift and a certificate for your child after participating in one of our studies. More broadly, the knowledge gained from our research contributes to our understanding of how children language. It is hoped that this knowledge will directly benefit families in advancing our understanding of how we can maximise our children's potential for success at language learning.</p>
